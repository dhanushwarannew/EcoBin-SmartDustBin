           As urban populations continue to grow, traditional waste management systems are becoming increasingly inefficient, leading to a range of challenges including overflowing bins, delayed collections, and environmental pollution. To address these issues, EcoBin: Smart Waste Management with Odor & GPS Tracking introduces a cutting-edge solution that combines modern technologies to create an intelligent, automated waste management system. The core of EcoBin is its ability to monitor the waste levels in real-time using an ultrasonic sensor, which sends alerts to waste management authorities when the bin is nearing capacity. In addition to this, the system incorporates an MQ-135 gas sensor designed to detect the presence of foul odors and harmful gases such as methane or ammonia. Upon detection, an automatic deodorization system is activated to neutralize the smell, ensuring that the bin remains hygienic and free from unpleasant odors until it is emptied. Furthermore, EcoBin includes a GPS module that tracks the location of the bin in real-time, allowing waste collection teams to optimize their routes and plan pickups more efficiently.The EcoBin project introduces an innovative approach to urban waste management by integrating IoT sensors and cloud-based technologies. This solution aims to optimize waste disposal processes, enhance sanitation, and improve overall environmental quality in urban spaces. By providing real-time monitoring, odor control, air quality checks, GPS location tracking, and hand gesture-controlled lid operation, EcoBin addresses common waste management challenges and paves the way for smarter, more sustainable cities
